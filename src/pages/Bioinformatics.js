                <p>
                as a fourth year biomedical computing student, iâ€™ve had the
                opportunity to work on my own research projects as well as aid others 
                in theirs. since taking my first AI course the past year, it has sparked a new
                interest in how AI will change the future of biotech.
                i hope to one day work in a hospital to help the healthcare field in
                clinical research in the bioinformatics field.

                    <h1>AI in DNA analysis research paper</h1>
                    <p> A research paper I wrote over 4 months, applying AI techniques into the world of bioinformatics.
                    i learned how to apply different AI techniques: CSPs, HMMs, CNNs into various DNA sequence analyses (Smith-Waterman, MSA, DeepBind, etc.).
